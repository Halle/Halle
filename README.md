### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name rhymes with (uncanny) valley. I live in Berlin, surrounded by an abundance of red squirrel frenemies. I like art and tech, hardware and software.

I made https://www.politepix.com and I blog at http://www.theoffcuts.org. You can find me at https://mastodon.social/@Halle and https://twitter.com/hallewinkler

I have a few MacOS Security Advisory credits [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212978) and [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213488) and [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213940).
